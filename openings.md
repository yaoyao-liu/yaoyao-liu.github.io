Thanks for your interest in joining my research group and collaborating with me. I am actively seeking self-motivated **PhD students**, **visiting students**, and **independent study students**. Candidates with a strong background in **computer vision**, **machine learning**, or **artificial intelligence** are highly encouraged to apply.


### Prospective PhD students

I have multiple PhD student openings in [Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/graduate/phd-information-sciences/) for Spring and Fall 2025 in the following research areas:

- **Continual learning and few-shot learning:** learning deep neural networks efficiently on limited labeled data and continual data streams. Related papers: [\[Sun et al., 2019\]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Sun_Meta-Transfer_Learning_for_Few-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf), [\[Liu et al., 2020\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10211.pdf), [\[Liu et al., 2021\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05063), [\[Liu et al., 2023\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05032), [\[Fischer et al., 2024\]](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yyliu/preprints/iNeMo_Incremental_Neural_Mesh_Models_for_Robust_Class-Incremental_Learning.pdf), etc.
- **3D generative models**: developing 3D-aware generative models to better understand the underlying 3D structures in 2D images. Related papers: [\[Ma et al., 2023\]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XlkN11Xj6J), [\[Fischer et al., 2024\]](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yyliu/preprints/iNeMo_Incremental_Neural_Mesh_Models_for_Robust_Class-Incremental_Learning.pdf), [\[Ma et al., 2024\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09613), etc.

If you are interested, please send an email to <email><a href="mailto:lyy+apply@g.illinois.edu">lyy+apply@g.illinois.edu</a></email> with your **CV** and **transcripts**. Please remember to submit your formal application through the [official system](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/graduate/phd-information-sciences/apply) as well.

### Visiting students and independent study students 

I always welcome visiting students and independent study students for collaboration across a wide range of research areas. If you are an undergraduate, master's, or PhD student and are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to reach out.
