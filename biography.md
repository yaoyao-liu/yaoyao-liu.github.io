I received my PhD in computer science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~schiele/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). As part of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Christian Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). I obtained my BS in electronic information engineering from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins University](https://cs.jhu.edu), working with [Prof. Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I was also a research intern at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/).
